# Design System: 22-django-starter

## Visual Philosophy
The design follows a **Technical Backend / Engineering Hub** aesthetic. It uses "Terminal Void" (Slate-950) with high-contrast "Python Green" (#22c55e to #10b981) accents, focusing on information density, command clarity, and structural reliability.

## Design Patterns
-   **Terminal Containers**: High-fidelity dark mode blocks with internal padding (P-8) and mono-spaced technical text.
-   **Capability Cards**: Geometric containers (P-10) with 10% green backgrounds and group-hover gradient border transitions.
-   **Admin Iconography**: Use of Terminal, Server, and Shield icons to symbolize backend robustness.
-   **Technical Gradients**: Vertical Green-to-Emerald linear flows for branding and Primary call-to-action buttons.

## Color Palette
-   **Void Core**: Slate-950 (#020617)
-   **Python Green**: Primary Accent (#22c55e)
-   **Django Emerald**: Secondary Accent (#10b981)
-   **Warning Gold**: Secondary Indicator (#f59e0b)

## Interaction Design
-   **Terminal Flow**: Sequential motion revealing (X: -20px) for command lines to simulate system initialization.
-   **Feedback Kinetics**: 1.1x scaling for backend tool categories on hover.
-   **Orchestration Hover**: 1px glowing boundaries on cards that activate during user focus.
